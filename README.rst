ARA: Ansible Run Analysis
=========================
.. image:: doc/source/_static/preview2.png

tl;dr
-----
ARA_ records Ansible_ Playbook runs seamlessly to make them easier to
visualize, understand and troubleshoot. It integrates with Ansible wherever you
run it.

ARA provides four things:

1. An `Ansible callback plugin`_ to record playbook runs into a local or remote database
2. The ara_record_ and ara_read_ pair of Ansible modules to record and read persistent data with ARA
3. A `CLI client`_ to query the database
4. A `dynamic, database-driven web interface`_ that can also be `generated and served from static files`_
